Priority
========

Single time series
------------------
- Basic SIR PF - R frontend / forecasting mechanism
- Learn POMP - focus on pMCMC / IF1 / IF2, then forecasting wrapper if not present
- HMCMC - R code for forecasting from Stan fitting data
- Simplex Projection / S-mapping - port code to R and/or C



Secondary
=========

Spatio-temporal
---------------
- Basic SIR PF - R front end / forecasting mechanism, C wrapper for CUDA backend
- HMCMC - Spacial model code, R code for forecasting from Stan fitting data
- Simplex Projection / S-mapping - Is this possible for spatio-temporal models?
- Data generator - more complex model formulations / noise sources



Tertiary
========

Single time series
------------------
- ARIMA - learn R toolbox

Spatio-temporal
---------------
- Kriged Kalman filter - research in general / see if there is an R toolbox / complexity?



Miscellaneous
=============

- Organize Thesis folder, then Git it all
