abstract = {In testing that a given distribution P belongs to a parameterized family P, one is often led to compare a nonparametric estimate An of some functional A of P with an element A$\theta$n corresponding to an estimate $\theta$n of $\theta$. In many cases, the asymptotic distribution of goodness-of-fit statistics derived from the process n1/2(An − A$\theta$n) depends on the unknown distribution P.Itis shown here that if the sequences An and $\theta$n of estimators are regular in some sense, a parametric bootstrap approach yields valid approximations for the P-values of the tests. In other words if A∗ from P$\theta$n , the empirical processes n1/2(An−A$\theta$n) and n1/2(A∗ n and $\theta$∗ n−A$\theta$∗ of the same limit. This result is used to establish the validity of the parametric bootstrap method when testing the goodness- of-fit of families of multivariate distributions and copulas. Two types of tests are considered: certain procedures compare the empirical version of a distribution function or copula and its parametric estimation under the null hypothesis; others measure the distance between a parametric and a nonparametric estimation of the distribution associated with the classical probability integral transform. The validity of a two-level bootstrap is also proved in cases where the parametric estimate cannot be computed easily. Themethodology is illustrated using a new goodness-of-fit test statistic for copulas based on a Cram{\'{e}}r–von Mises functional of the empirical copula process. n are analogs of An and $\theta$n computed from a sample n ) then converge jointly in distribution to independent copies},
