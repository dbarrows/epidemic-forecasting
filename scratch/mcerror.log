The following numerical problems occured the indicated number of times after warmup on chain 1
                                                                                         count

When a numerical problem occurs, the Metropolis proposal gets rejected.
However, by design Metropolis proposals sometimes get rejected even when there are no numerical problems.
Thus, if the number in the 'count' column is small, do not ask about this message on stan-users.
